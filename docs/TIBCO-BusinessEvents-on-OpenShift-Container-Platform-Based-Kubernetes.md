
You can run any TIBCO BusinessEvents application on OpenShift Container Platform based Kubernetes cluster and monitor them by using TIBCO BusinessEvents Enterprise Administrator Agent. You can also manage business rules through WebStudio by running RMS on OpenShift Container Platform based Kubernetes cluster.

For details, see [OpenShift Container Platform documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform).

## Readme for Sample Applications

TIBCO BusinessEvents provides readme.html files to help you in running the sample applications and components on OpenShift Container Platform. You can follow the instruction in the readme.html file to run the application, WebStudio, and TIBCO BusinessEvents Enterprise Administrator Agent by using the provided sample YAML files.

The following table lists location of readme.html and sample YAML files for running sample applications and other components:
